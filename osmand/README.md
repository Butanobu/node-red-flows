OSMAnd flows

I use the fantastic OSMAnd+ app on Android, coupled with the simple and useful MobiWIA GPS Status app to provide offline, reliable maps and navigation in Europe, Japan and the UK.

To me, both apps are worth the price of their premium price tag.

It just so happens that OSMAnd has a live recording feature that will HTTP GET location and speed information to the URL of your choice.

Sounds like a job for Node Red...
